# Hell Triangle

Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom
Example:
	6
   3 5
  9 7 1
 4 6 8 4
In this triangle the maximum total is: 6 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 26
An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row.
For example: The element 3 in the 2nd row can only be summed with 9 and 7, but not with 1
